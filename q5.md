i(
1. The first approch first create an empty list and after that it loop through the param and multiplies the value i by 2 and append is to the list. And after calls the function and use it as an argument and itereates over the list it returns.
2. The second approch show as the same output but this time it uses the comprehension list so instead of writing a another function for it, we just write it in one line and has the same output.
3. The third approch this function is uses the concept of generators and yield. So in this case instead of creating a list or appending values, it produces a value and suspends the functionâ€™s execution which means it yields a value each time the loops run.)

ii. (
1. This function is generator function which means the instead of using return is the keyword "yield".
This function is useful with dealing large amount of data when we do not want to store them to the memory all at ones.
Despite all other approches produce the same output this in particular is better for our modern techonology because we always work with huge amount of data
